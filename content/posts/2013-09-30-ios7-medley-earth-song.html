<p>What about colors<br />
What about pain<br />
What about all the speeds<br />
That you said we were to gain...<br />
What about killing flares<br />
That hurts the eye<br />
What about all the things<br />
That you said was good and fine...<br />
Did you ever stop to notice<br />
All the apps we've shed before<br />
Did you ever stop to notice<br />
This crying eye this candy gore?</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah</p>
<p>What have we done to the phone<br />
Look what we've done<br />
What about all the neat<br />
That you turned into flat...<br />
What about long animations<br />
Is there a time<br />
What about innovations<br />
That you said were yours and shine...<br />
Did you ever stop to notice<br />
All the chineese foxconn war<br />
Did you ever stop to notice<br />
This cheap materials for even more?</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah</p>
<p>I used to look<br />
For the flashlight in the store<br />
Now I don't know where we are<br />
Although I know we've drifted far</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah<br />
Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah</p>
<p>Hey, what about lockscreen<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about folders<br />
(What about us)<br />
The gradients are everywhere<br />
(What about us)<br />
I can't even breathe<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about iconography<br />
(What about us)<br />
Can't we feel its shape<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about default font<br />
(ooo, ooo)<br />
It's our iphone's tomb<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about chat baloons<br />
(What about it)<br />
We've turned design to dust<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about Stevie's team<br />
(What about us)<br />
Have we lost their trust<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about champagne<br />
(What about us)<br />
Are we even serious<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about this 5C<br />
(ooo, ooo)<br />
Bumpers rule us now<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about the holy land<br />
(What about it)<br />
Torn apart by Ive<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about the common 4S<br />
(What about us)<br />
Can't we let it be<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about children playing<br />
(What about us)<br />
Can't you hear them cry<br />
(What about us)<br />
Where did we go wrong<br />
(ooo, ooo)<br />
Someone tell me why<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about thumbs got cut<br />
(What about it)<br />
What about the days<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about all our joy<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about the iOS6<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about the perfection<br />
(What about us)<br />
What about idealistic form<br />
(What was us)<br />
Instead of this hipster shit<br />
(ooo, ooo)<br />
Do we give a damn</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah</p>
