<p>I can give you the story<br />
I can give you the words<br />
Well just who will be sorry<br />
With his fingers wide crossed</p>
<p>For the story is rough<br />
And the words aren't nice<br />
Your dreams are too tough<br />
Just to open your eyes</p>
<p>Guess you learned not to see<br />
Or you don't need the chance<br />
But once it worked for me<br />
It worked for me, once</p>
<p>I remember those eyes<br />
No, they weren't breathtaking<br />
Without sugar and spice<br />
And no thrill of ground-shaking<br />
They had worlds all behind<br />
The bright eyes of awakening</p>
